Objective

To create an automated report that extracts data from Google Analytics for one of our current clients
(MN, 5, or SR have the best data).  The report will be a single page and analyze sessions, pageviews,
transactions, and sales for the past 30 days.  After weâ€™ve created this automated report, we will consider
adding in features for future recommendations.

Recap for 9.22 - Lexi

We set up our computers with a proper IDLE (so PyCharm and Anaconda should have you covered), and also
created + tested file sharing on GitHub (through PyCharm it's easy, Terminal is a little more tricky).

So now we can collaborate on the project. The next step is to set up the project skeleton. You've noticed
that when you look at other repos in GitHub, there's all sorts of folders and pages with info. There's no
set way to do this, just how we think it's best organizationally for ourselves (that's why they're all
different from repo to repo)

Much of the organization has to do with the packages that we need to use. So the next step IMO is to
get the packages and modules working on our computers (maybe have them on our shared repo also)? Anyway
let's see if we can get this to work:

I would like to think that the script, when working properly, can straight pull data from Analytics
Have a look and we'll see
